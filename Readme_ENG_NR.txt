DESCRIPTION:
The goal of the game is to collect as many red crosses as possible.
You can assemble crosses using the "z" or "7" keys. The player can also increase the maximum number of crosses on the board using a special button, but it can be used no more than once in 20 seconds.
The collection of crosses will be prevented by pits appearing on the field from time to time (when a player gets into which the game ends), marked with dark circles.
The player has the opportunity to find out where the pits are located on the field. To do this, he can use a lantern that illuminates the cell on which he stands, as well as all those adjacent to it on the side.
To get a lantern, the player must press the "s" or "5" key while on a cell. At the same time, you can't take a flashlight twice while on the same cell (a lantern taken from any cell can be transferred to another cell). When a lantern is taken from a cell, a pit is formed in one of the cells adjacent to it at the corner, and the cell itself acquires a red contour, indicating that a lantern has already been taken from it.
If a hole soon appears in the illuminated cell, this cell will begin to be highlighted in red.

MOVEMENT KEYS:
"w" or "2" - up
"x" or "8" - down
"a" or "4" - left
"d" or "6" - right

IMPORTANT:
For the correct operation of the game, the folder with the program must contain the RECORD.txt file. If this file is not available, you need to manually create it and write 1 character in it - "0".
If you want to end the game early, you should do it through a special button.
